        <p> <strong>Carpool Commute</strong>
            <br><br>
            <strong>We are on a mission to</strong>
            improve the urban environment by enabling neighbours to commuter carpool and reduce the
            amount of cars on the roads, thereby reducing traffic congestion and air pollution!
            <br><br>
            <strong>Casual visitors </strong>to the site will be able to search through the posts to see
            if anyone faces a similar commute to theirs.
            <br><br>
            <strong>While any visitor </strong>can search through the various
            posts, full details of other commuters and their journeys will only be available after
            registering to this web site.
